# E-Commerce Back-End Development

## Description

This is a project to practice setting up a back-end application using Sequelize and MySQL. It is also an excellent way to demonstrate how to use Insomnia. I have put together a video demonstration of how all of the routes work.

## Instructions

In order to utilize this application, you will need to clone this github. You will need to preform an npm install in order to utilize the required packages in this application. After completing that, you will need to create and seed the database on your local machine. The command "npm run seed" will work, or you can initilize it with node. From there, it's free to use and customize in any way you want!
